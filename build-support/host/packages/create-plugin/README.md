# @tabularis/create-plugin

Scaffold a new [Tabularis](https://github.com/TabularisDB/tabularis) database driver plugin in seconds.

```bash
npm create @tabularis/plugin@latest my-driver
```

(Works the same with `pnpm create @tabularis/plugin@latest my-driver` or `yarn create @tabularis/plugin my-driver`.)

## Declarative themes

The separate `tabularis-theme` entry point scaffolds, validates and packages themes
without changing the driver command's defaults. Generated theme repositories work
offline with their bundled Node tool. See [the theme author guide](./THEMES.md) for
local preview, VS Code conversion, licensing, version gates and GitHub/Tabularium
publishing. This new entry point requires the updated tooling package or a local
source build; it is not assumed available in an older published version.

## What you get

A runnable Rust project with:

- **`.tabularium`** bundle manifest aligned with the Tabularis plugin schema.
- **33 JSON-RPC handlers pre-wired** — metadata methods return empty arrays (plugin loads cleanly), query/CRUD/DDL methods return `-32601` until you implement them.
- **`test_connection` placeholder** that returns success, so your driver appears in the connection picker immediately after `just dev-install`.
- **Working utilities**: `quote_identifier`, `paginate` — with unit tests — ready to use from your handlers.
- **Cross-platform GitHub Actions release workflow** for Linux x64/arm64, macOS x64/arm64, and Windows x64.
- **Local REPL (`just repl`)** for debugging without restarting Tabularis.
- **Optional UI extension subworkspace** (`--with-ui`) pre-configured with Vite IIFE + `@tabularis/plugin-api`.

## Usage

```bash
npm create @tabularis/plugin@latest [--] [options] <name>
```

`--` separates the package name from the flags so they reach the CLI instead of npm. If you prefer the direct form:

```bash
npx @tabularis/create-plugin [options] <name>
```

### Options

| Flag | Values | Default | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|---------|
| `--db-type` | `network` \| `file` \| `folder` \| `api` | `network` | Shapes the connection form and capabilities |
| `--quote` | `"` \| `` ` `` | `"` | SQL identifier quote character |
| `--with-ui` | boolean | off | Also scaffold a `ui/` subworkspace using `@tabularis/plugin-api` |
| `--no-git` | boolean | off | Skip `git init` |
| `--dir` | path | `./<name>` | Target directory |

### Examples

```bash
# Network driver (host/port/user/pass connection form)
npm create @tabularis/plugin@latest my-pg-like

# File-based driver (SQLite, DuckDB shape)
npm create @tabularis/plugin@latest duckdb-clone -- --db-type=file

# API-based plugin (no connection form; public REST-ish data source)
npm create @tabularis/plugin@latest my-api -- --db-type=api

# With UI extension scaffold
npm create @tabularis/plugin@latest mine -- --with-ui
```

## Next steps after scaffolding

```bash
cd my-driver
just dev-install              # builds and installs into ~/.local/share/tabularis/plugins/my-driver
# open Tabularis → your driver is in the connection picker
```

From there, fill in handlers in `src/handlers/metadata.rs`, then `query.rs`, then the rest. The generated `README.md` includes a feature-by-feature roadmap.

## Migrating an existing plugin

Plugins built before the registry cutover ship a `manifest.json`. The host now
reads a `.tabularium` bundle manifest (the `manifest.json` path survives only as
a deprecated fallback). To convert a project in place:

```bash
npx @tabularis/create-plugin migrate            # current directory
npx @tabularis/create-plugin migrate ./my-driver
```

This writes `.tabularium` from your `manifest.json`, removes the old file, and
updates the `manifest.json` references in `release.yml`, `justfile`, and
`README.md`. A legacy `id` that differs from `name` is kept for the host's
benefit only — the registry has no `id` field and keys everything off `name`
(the pinned lowercase slug). The command refuses to run if the manifest has no
semver `version`, which the registry requires — without a leading `v`, and it
must equal the release tag stripped of any `v` prefix.

By default the release workflow is left as-is (only its `manifest.json`
reference is renamed so the build keeps working). The hosted Tabularium registry
resolves the manifest from the **release assets**, so it needs `.tabularium`
published as a standalone asset (GitHub renames the dotfile to
`default.tabularium` on upload — the registry accepts either name). Add `--ci`
to regenerate `release.yml` from the registry-ready template:

```bash
npx @tabularis/create-plugin migrate ./my-driver --ci
```

`--ci` overwrites `release.yml` (re-apply any custom CI steps) and derives the
binary name from the manifest's `executable` field. Commit the result and
republish.

## Requirements

- Node 18.17 or newer.
- Rust stable (for building the generated plugin).
- `just` (optional but recommended — the generated `justfile` wraps the common tasks).
